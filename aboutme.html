            <p>I'm a mom, college graduate, and a late-blooming book lover. During my undergraduate and graduate years,
                I read so many textbooks and papers that I developed a bit of a resistance to reading, even reading for
                fun. After
                graduating in 2016, it took me years before I picked up books regularly purely for enjoyment again.</p>
            <p>Now as a mom to two young kids, I'm rediscovering the joy of reading. It's not only a great
                way to unwind, but it also helps me connect with friends through shared book interests and engaging
                conversations. I mostly listen to audiobooks through Libby, allowing me to multitask while doing my
                usual stuff like driving kids around, cooking, working out, or tidying up. Although I donâ€™t read
                physical
                books as often, I love taking one to the pool or beach during the summer for a relaxing read. </p>
            <p>I've found myself enjoying a variety of genres, but nonfiction might be my favorite. While not listed
                on this site, I'll also mention that I have come to really appreciate good children's books and
                absolutely
                love reading to my kids as a way of connecting with them and teaching important life lessons. </p>
            <p>I hope my book lists and honest, genuine, non-expert reviews can inspire you to read more...purely for
                fun. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
