            <p>I loved this book! Elizabeth Zott was not your average 1960's woman. She was a brilliant chemist who was
                acutely aware of and intolerant of the rampant sexism in her workplace but did not let that stop her
                from
                working toward her goals. It was fascinating but also infuriating being engrossed in her perspective and
                feeling what she went through as a woman during that time period. She dared other women to change the
                status
                quo. The book also made me reflect on the treatment of women today in American society and draw
                parallels
                between then and now. I highly recommed this book. Bonus: AppleTV also made it into a show which I
                recently
                started. (Trigger warning: Both the book and show include scenes of sexual assault.) </p>

            <p>This book had a very interesting premise. Between life and death there is a library. When Nora finds
                herself
                in the Midnight Library, she has a chance to make things right. Up until this point, her life has been
                full
                of unhappiness and regret. But things are about to change. The books in the Midnight Library enable Nora
                to
                live as if she had done things differently, undoing each regret and attempting to work out her perfect
                life. But things aren't always what she imagined they'd be, and soon she is working against the clock.
                Before time runs out, she must answer the ultimate question: what is the best way to live? I saw so many
                great things about this book but rated it like I did simply because I felt it was a little slow and
                didn't
                live up to the hype in my opinion. </p>

            <p>This was a heartfelt novel of friendship, betrayal, and redemption set against three transformative
                decades in Tehran, Iran. I had never read a book set in Iran and it was fascinating to learn what living
                there as a woman was like in the 1950's amid political turmoil. Although this is fiction, the author
                spent some of her childhood in Iran during a pivitol time in its history and drew on her own
                experiences with a friendship she had growing up. I loved this book because of the beautiful
                descriptions
                of the Iranian setting, foods, and lifestyle in the book. It was a moving story and
                extremely well-written with characters I came to love!</p>

                But over the course of 24 hours, their lives change dramatically. This book was a purely "for

                <p>Meet Eleanor Oliphant: She is socially awkward and says out loud exactly what she is thinking. Her
                    life has been the same for decades, mundane office work and then solitary weekends spent only with
                    frozen pizza,
                    vodka, and bitter phone chats with Mummy.

                    But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the unattractive, unhygienic IT guy from her
                    office. They rescue one another from the lives of isolation and Raymond helps heal her deep
                    emotional
                    wounds from her past. I thought this story was simultaneously strange and charming. The author
                    enables you to
                    really feel what Eleanor felt and see from her unique perspective. This book helped me remember that
                    everyone is dealing with their own internal struggles and past experiences that makes them who they
                    are.</p>

                            abusive father along with her fierce-hearted black "stand-in mother," Rosaleen. They are
                            taken in by an eccentric trio of black beekeeping sisters. I liked the female power and
                            resistance

                                        faeries with wings and their pointy ears. I honestly tried. I even tried
                                        reading the second book as well. It is so incredibly popular and I was told
                                        so many
                                        times to
                                        read this book and to push through it. But I actually am pretty sensitive to
                                        violence and gore and there was a little too much descriptive violence in it
                                        to the point where it gave me bad dreams. I'm a sensitive little muffin. So
                                        I don't think I can read ACOTAR further. I do agree, however, that the story
                                        overall is quite good, complex, and deep so I understand the hype...(but why
                                        must it have fairies?)
