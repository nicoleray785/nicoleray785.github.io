            <h2>Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus (4.5/5)</h2>
            <p>I loved this book! Elizabeth Zott was not your average 1960's woman. She was a brilliant chemist who was
                acutely aware of and intolerant of the rampant sexism in her workplace but did not let that stop her
                from
                working toward her goals. It was fascinating but also infuriating being engrossed in her perspective and
                feeling what she went through as a woman during that time period. She dared other women to change the
                status
                quo. The book also made me reflect on the treatment of women today in American society and draw
                parallels
                between then and now. I highly recommed this book. Bonus: AppleTV also made it into a show which I
                recently
                started. (Trigger warning: Both the book and show include scenes of sexual assault.) </p>

            <h2>The Midnight Library by Matt Haig (3/5)</h2>
            <p>This book had a very interesting premise. Between life and death there is a library. When Nora finds
                herself
                in the Midnight Library, she has a chance to make things right. Up until this point, her life has been
                full
                of unhappiness and regret. But things are about to change. The books in the Midnight Library enable Nora
                to
                live as if she had done things differently, undoing each regret and attempting to work out her perfect
                life. But things aren't always what she imagined they'd be, and soon she is working against the clock.
                Before time runs out, she must answer the ultimate question: what is the best way to live? I saw so many
                great things about this book but rated it like I did simply because I felt it was a little slow and
                didn't
                live up to the hype in my opinion. </p>
