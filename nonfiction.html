            <p> A memoir as gripping as it is moving, Solito provides an immediate and
                intimate account not only of the treacherous and near-impossible 3,000 mile journey to get across the
                U.S border from Central America,
                but also of the miraculous kindness and love delivered at the most
                unexpected moments. Solito is Javier Zamora’s story, but it’s also the story
                of millions of others who had no choice but to leave home in search of a better life. This book was very
                descriptive and through a 9 year-olds eyes. It was an emotional and incredible read.</p>

            <p>This book changed the way I think about people and helped me see the good in humanity in a population I
                admittedly hadn't previously given much thought to, gangs in LA. Father Gregory teaches through parables
                about individuals he met that no matter where people live or what their
                circumstances may be, everyone needs boundless, restorative love. Gorgeous and uplifting, this book
                shows the impact unconditional love can have on your life and reminds us that no life is less
                valuable than another.</p>

                <p>These days demonstrations of extremism is not hard to notice among groups of people. The psychology
                    of cults kind of fascinates me. The author analyzes the social science of cult influence and
                    discusses answers to questions like "What makes “cults” so intriguing and frightening? What makes
                    them powerful? Could it happen to someone I know? Or to me?" It's interesting to pause and reflect
                    on cultish influence in my own life or things I've observed in my circles-- even just cultish
                    language, which actually is the key to manufacturing intense ideology, community, and us/them
                    attitudes. I
                    rated it 4 stars just because there were some parts that weren't too engaging for me personally, but
                    really I thought this was very informative and interesting. </p>

                        James Clear's email newsletter is great too. This is a wildly popular book for good reason.

                            <p>Hey, did you notice what I did there?? 6/5 stars!!! Yes, I can do that because
                                this is my own website. Everyone needs to hear the message of this book! And guess what,
                                they CAN!
                                Because this is a 3 hour audio book (and even faster at 1.5x speed). In a series of 28
                                brief arguments, the author deftly makes the case for moving the abortion debate away
                                from
                                controlling and legislating women’s bodies and instead directs the focus on men’s lack
                                of accountability in preventing unwanted pregnancies. It's not a boring series of essays
                                either. Blair builds her argument in an engaging and enjoyable way. </p>
                            <p>She walks readers
                                through the basics of fertility (men are 50x more fertile than woman), the unfair burden
                                placed
                                on women when it comes to preventing pregnancy (90% of the birth control market is for
                                women), the wrongheaded stigmas around birth control for men (condoms make sex less
                                pleasurable, vasectomies are scary and emasculating), and the counterintuitive reality
                                that men, who are fertile 100% of the time, take little to no responsibility for
                                preventing pregnancy. The result is a compelling and convincing case for placing the
                                responsibility—and burden—of preventing unwanted pregnancies away from women and onto
                                men. Absolutely incredible, fact-driven book that our society needs to consider for the
                                health of women.</p>

                                        baked into society. And women pay huge costs for this bias, in time, money, and

                                            Montessori is an alternative education
                                            system where, instead of the teacher standing at the front of the classroom
                                            telling the kids what they need to know, the children are free to explore a
                                            classroom of well-designed materials. This allows kids to follow
                                            their unique natural rhythm and development and make discoveries for
                                            themselves. This book teaches how to make your home more Montessori aligned,
                                            with any sized home and budget. I appreciated that aspect of it and found it
                                            encouraging, applicable, and attainable as a parent who isn't trained in
                                            Montessori methods. Loved this book! The authors have also written a

                                                religion I grew up in. The author, a former pastor, proposes a 4 stage
                                                model of faith development in which questions and doubt are not the

                                                    amazing lessons from this book. Dr. Becky’s empowering and effective
                                                    approach is a model that prioritizes *connecting* with our kids over
                                                    correcting them. She teaches that all kids are good and when we
                                                    recognize that we can parent them better. I love this book and Dr.
